An premature assignment project for CVWO. Unfortunately I tried to integrate React & Typescript with Vite but somehow it doesn't work and I can't find relate tutorials and resolve it in time.

## To Run
Enter the folder and run 
``` bash
$ bundle install
$ npm install
$ ./bin/vite dev
$ ./bin/rails s
```
And then open up a browser on https://localhost:3000
